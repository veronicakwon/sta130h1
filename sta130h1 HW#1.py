# This is the conversation I had with ChatGPT (for some reason I could not retrieve the link to the conversation so I used copy and paste instead). 
# 
# Prompt: hello ! please provide an interesting, quirky dataset that may have missing values!
# 
# ChatGPT said:
# ChatGPT
# Here's an example of an interesting and quirky dataset that might contain missing values:
# 
# Dataset: UFO Sightings
# 
# Description: This dataset contains records of UFO sightings across the world, including details about the sighting such as location, date, duration, shape of the UFO, and any witness descriptions. Missing values can occur due to incomplete witness reports, unclear observations, or lack of data from official records.
# Sample Data Fields:
# Date/Time of sighting: When the UFO was sighted (missing data if the witness doesn't remember the exact date).
# Location (City, Country): Where the sighting took place (missing if the location is unclear or not reported).
# Shape of UFO: Reported shape (e.g., disk, sphere, triangle) (missing if the shape wasn't observed clearly).
# Duration: How long the sighting lasted (missing if the time was not recorded).
# Witness count: Number of people who observed the event (missing if the count is uncertain).
# Description: Detailed witness account (could be incomplete or vague).
# Potential Missing Values:
# Date or time may be missing if the witness can't recall exactly when they saw the UFO.
# The exact shape of the UFO may not always be provided.
# Some reports might not include a specific location or duration, especially if the event was fleeting.
# Descriptions could be vague or absent altogether, depending on the detail of the witness's recollection.
# This quirky dataset would be ideal for exploring techniques like data imputation, handling of missing values, and even applying machine learning algorithms for predicting missing fields based on patterns in the data.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# You said:
# can you provide me a real dataset based on the response you just said? i would like the link to it as well as the code that was used to create it.
# 
# ChatGPT said:
# ChatGPT
# You can find real UFO sightings datasets from public sources such as Kaggle or official UFO tracking websites. One popular dataset is hosted on Kaggle: NUFORC UFO Sightings which is provided by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). This dataset contains records of UFO sightings reported from around the world, with various attributes that may include missing values.
# 
# Here’s the link to the dataset on Kaggle:
# 
# NUFORC UFO Sightings Dataset
# You can download the dataset from Kaggle and use the following Python code to load and inspect it for missing values:
# 
# Code to Load and Analyze the UFO Dataset:
# python
# Copy code
# 
# Key Steps:
# Load the Dataset: You load the dataset using pd.read_csv().
# Check Missing Values: The isnull() method counts missing values in each column.
# Handle Missing Values: For example, you can impute the most frequent value (mode) to fill in missing shape values.
# Save the Cleaned Dataset: After cleaning, save it to a new file using to_csv().
# Let me know if you need further assistance with the dataset or code!
# 
# 
# (The code is shown below)
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 

# In[ ]:


# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset (you will need to download the CSV file from Kaggle and place it in your directory)
ufo_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_file/ufo_sightings_large.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset to get an overview
print(ufo_data.head())

# Check for missing values in the dataset
missing_values = ufo_data.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values in each column:")
print(missing_values)

# Display percentage of missing values
missing_percentage = (missing_values / len(ufo_data)) * 100
print("Percentage of missing values in each column:")
print(missing_percentage)

# Example: Impute missing values in 'shape' column using the mode of the column
ufo_data['shape'].fillna(ufo_data['shape'].mode()[0], inplace=True)

# Save the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file
ufo_data.to_csv('cleaned_ufo_sightings.csv', index=False)


# 2.
# 
# And now I asked it for additional information:
# 
# Prompt: 
# 
# I've downloaded a dataset about UFO sightings from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings?resource=download, and I'd like to know what columns of information I have and how much data I have.
# ChatGPT said:

# It seems there was an issue reading one of the files (complete.csv) due to inconsistent fields in one of the rows. I'll handle this by loading the data in chunks and skip problematic rows.
# 
# Let me process that and give you the details. ​​
# 
# The dataset contains two files:
# 
# complete.csv:
# 
# Columns:
# datetime, city, state, country, shape, duration (seconds), duration (hours/min), comments, date posted, latitude, longitude
# Size: 88,679 rows and 11 columns.
# scrubbed.csv:
# 
# Columns:
# datetime, city, state, country, shape, duration (seconds), duration (hours/min), comments, date posted, latitude, longitude
# Size: 80,332 rows and 11 columns.
# Let me know how you'd like to proceed with this data! ​

# 3. Now I asked it for a summary and some code to go along with it:

# 
# You said:
# I need help analyzing my data!
# ChatGPT said:
# ChatGPT
# I'd be happy to help you analyze the UFO sightings data! Here are a few analysis tasks we can start with:
# 
# Basic Descriptive Statistics: Summarize the data with mean, median, and distribution of key fields like sighting duration, number of sightings per country or state, etc.
# 
# Time-Series Analysis:
# 
# Analyze UFO sightings trends over time (yearly/monthly trends).
# Identify peak periods or seasonal patterns.
# Geospatial Analysis:
# 
# Map sightings by location (latitude/longitude).
# Group sightings by country, state, or city.
# Shape & Duration Patterns:
# 
# Study common UFO shapes reported and their average durations.
# Find the most frequent UFO shapes per country or state.
# Sentiment/Keyword Analysis:
# 
# Perform text analysis on the comments field to extract common keywords or phrases.
# Detect patterns or sentiment in the descriptions of sightings.
# Which of these interests you most, or do you have something specific you'd like to explore?
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# You said:
# What's the most simple form of summarization of this dataset that I could do and how do i do it in python?
# ChatGPT said:
# ChatGPT
# A simple summarization of your dataset would involve generating basic descriptive statistics and inspecting the general structure of the data. Here's what you can do:
# 
# Get an overview of the dataset:
# 
# Check the first few rows of the data.
# Check for missing values.
# Check the data types of the columns.
# Basic Descriptive Statistics:
# 
# Count the number of rows and columns.
# Describe numerical columns (e.g., duration (seconds)).
# Count unique values in categorical columns like country, state, and shape.
# Python Code to Do This
# Here’s how you can do it step by step:
# 
# python
# Copy code
# 
# This gives you a broad understanding of the data structure and a summary of the most important aspects.
# 
# Would you like me to run this on your dataset for you?
# 
# (The code is shown below)

# In[ ]:


# Basic overview
print("First few rows of the dataset:")
print(df.head())

# Check for missing values
print("\nMissing values per column:")
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Get the data types
print("\nData types of the columns:")
print(df.dtypes)

# Basic statistics for numerical columns
print("\nDescriptive statistics for numerical columns:")
print(df.describe())

# Count of unique values in categorical columns
print("\nUnique value counts for categorical columns (e.g., country, state, shape):")
print(df['country'].value_counts())
print(df['state'].value_counts())
print(df['shape'].value_counts())


# 4.
# 
# Next I asked for more clarification regarding whether I have missing values/non numeric values and why that may be. 
# 
# Ah ok. does this dataset not have any non numeric variables and missing values in numeric variables? can you help explain the discrepancies between the size of the dataset and what is reported with respect to the number of columns it analyzes?
# ChatGPT said:
# ChatGPT
# Yes, this dataset contains both non-numeric variables and may have missing values in numeric fields. I'll explain both aspects in more detail:
# 
# 1. Non-Numeric Variables
# The dataset includes several non-numeric (categorical and textual) columns such as:
# 
# city: The name of the city where the sighting occurred.
# state: The state where the sighting was reported.
# country: The country of the sighting.
# shape: Describes the shape of the UFO sighted (e.g., "circle," "triangle").
# comments: Textual descriptions of the sightings.
# datetime: The date and time of the sighting, which is typically stored as a string unless parsed into a date format.
# These non-numeric columns won't appear in standard descriptive statistics (like mean, std) since they are not numbers. However, you can summarize them by counting unique values or frequencies.
# 
# 2. Missing Values in Numeric Variables
# Some of the numeric columns (like duration (seconds)) may have missing values. If numeric columns have missing values, Python's pandas library will exclude those rows when performing statistical operations like calculating mean or standard deviation.
# 
# Checking for missing values is important to understand the completeness of the data, especially in critical columns like duration or latitude/longitude.
# Missing values can also be handled by filling in values (e.g., using the median) or excluding the incomplete rows.
# 3. Discrepancies in Dataset Size
# The size discrepancy you mentioned could arise for several reasons:
# Skipped rows: When reading the dataset, rows that don't fit the expected format might be skipped, as was the case with complete.csv. This can lead to fewer rows being loaded.
# Malformed entries: If a row has more or fewer columns than expected, it can cause the parser to throw an error and skip the row, as happened in the case of the complete.csv file.
# Different number of columns: Sometimes the dataset might report a larger or smaller number of columns due to merged or incorrectly split data fields (for example, an extra column due to an unhandled comma in a textual field).
# In your case:
# 
# complete.csv had some parsing issues with rows having an unexpected number of fields, so some rows were skipped.
# The dataset should have 11 columns, but malformed rows may not be loaded correctly, causing the discrepancy in the total row count.
# Would you like guidance on how to handle missing values or how to clean up the dataset to resolve discrepancies?
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# You said:
# yes please!
# ChatGPT said:
# ChatGPT
# To handle missing values and clean up the dataset, here are the key steps you can follow in Python:
# 
# 1. Check for Missing Values
# Before cleaning up missing values, you need to see which columns have missing data and how much is missing.
# 
# python
# Copy code
# # Check for missing values in each column
# print(df.isnull().sum())
# This will show the number of missing values in each column.
# 
# 2. Handle Missing Values
# Depending on the nature of the missing data, you can choose one of the following strategies:
# 
# Option 1: Drop Rows with Missing Values
# If the number of missing values is small and you don't need those rows, you can simply drop them.
# 
# python
# Copy code
# # Drop rows with missing values
# df_clean = df.dropna()
# This method removes all rows that have any missing values. If you want to drop only rows with missing values in specific columns, you can specify them like this:
# 
# python
# Copy code
# df_clean = df.dropna(subset=['duration (seconds)', 'latitude', 'longitude'])
# Option 2: Fill Missing Values
# If you don't want to lose data, you can fill the missing values with a placeholder (such as the column mean, median, or a custom value).
# 
# For numeric columns:
# 
# python
# Copy code
# # Fill missing values in 'duration (seconds)' with the mean
# df['duration (seconds)'] = df['duration (seconds)'].fillna(df['duration (seconds)'].mean())
# For categorical/text columns:
# 
# python
# Copy code
# # Fill missing values in 'shape' with 'unknown'
# df['shape'] = df['shape'].fillna('unknown')
# 3. Resolve Malformed Rows
# If you have rows that caused parsing issues (like too many or too few columns), you can handle them by reading the file in a more controlled way. Here’s how you can avoid problems with variable numbers of columns:
# 
# Read the CSV with manual column assignment: This helps if the data has issues with column alignment.
# python
# Copy code
# # Specify the expected number of columns and their names
# column_names = ['datetime', 'city', 'state', 'country', 'shape', 'duration (seconds)', 'duration (hours/min)', 'comments', 'date posted', 'latitude', 'longitude']
# df = pd.read_csv('file.csv', names=column_names, header=0, error_bad_lines=False)
# 4. Convert Data Types (Optional but Important)
# To ensure all numeric columns are properly recognized and usable, it's a good idea to convert data types.
# 
# For example, convert duration (seconds) to float:
# 
# python
# Copy code
# df['duration (seconds)'] = pd.to_numeric(df['duration (seconds)'], errors='coerce')
# You can also parse the datetime column into a proper date format:
# 
# python
# Copy code
# df['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['datetime'], errors='coerce')
# Summary
# Step 1: Check for missing values with isnull().
# Step 2: Either drop rows with missing values or fill them with a placeholder.
# Step 3: Re-read malformed rows, ensuring correct column structure.
# Step 4: Convert data types if necessary (especially for dates and numeric fields).
# Would you like to try implementing this cleanup strategy, or do you need further details on a specific step?

# 5.
# 
# Then I asked for guidance to understand the difference between a method and a
# 
# Oh also, can you help me understand the difference between an attribute, like df.shape which does not end with a (), and a method such as df.describe which ends with a ()?
# ChatGPT said:
# ChatGPT
# Great question! The difference between an attribute (like df.shape) and a method (like df.describe()) lies in their purpose and how they work in Python.
# 
# 1. Attributes (e.g., df.shape)
# Definition: An attribute is a property or a characteristic of an object that stores some information about the object.
# 
# Usage: Attributes are accessed without parentheses because they do not perform any action. Instead, they just return the current state of a property.
# 
# Example: df.shape returns the dimensions of the DataFrame (number of rows and columns) as a tuple, like (100, 11). It’s just fetching an internal value that's already available.
# 
# python
# Copy code
# # Attribute - No parentheses
# print(df.shape)  # Outputs: (100, 11)
# 2. Methods (e.g., df.describe())
# Definition: A method is a function associated with an object that performs an operation on that object.
# 
# Usage: Methods are called with parentheses because they are functions and may take parameters. When you call a method, it often processes data or executes an action.
# 
# Example: df.describe() calculates and returns a summary of statistics for the DataFrame. The parentheses are needed because it's a function that triggers computations.
# 
# python
# Copy code
# # Method - Requires parentheses
# print(df.describe())  # Outputs a statistical summary
# Key Differences:
# Attributes are like static properties—they don’t change unless the object itself is modified, and they just give you information about the object’s current state.
# Methods are like actions—they do something with the object, like modifying it, calculating something, or returning a processed result.
# Analogy:
# Think of an object (like a DataFrame) as a car:
# 
# An attribute is like the car's color—you just look at it, and it’s a fixed property of the car.
# A method is like turning on the engine—you take an action to make something happen.
# Does that help clarify the difference between attributes and methods?
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# You said:
# yes! thanks.
# ChatGPT said:
# ChatGPT
# You're welcome! I'm glad the explanation helped. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Happy coding! 😊

# This is my paraphrased summary:
# An attribute is like a property or characteristic that is fixed unless the object is changed. 
# A method does something with the object, either making adjustments or returning something that it does.

# 6.
# 
# Defintions of data statistics:
# - Count: the total number of non-missing values in each column
# - Mean: the average of the data. 
# - Standard Deviation: the spread of data. It shows how much the every value deviates from the average. 
# - Min: the minimum value in a column
# - 25%: the value where 25% of the data falls
# - 50%: essentially the median (middle value of the data)
# - 75%: the value where 75% of the data lies
# - Max: the maximum value. 

# 7. 
# 
# 1. Provide an example of a "use case" in which using df.dropna() might be preferred over using del df['col']
# 
#     Use df.dropna() as opposed to del df['col'] when you need to remove a row or column that has missing values instead of deleting an entire column. For example, when you want to analyze every column but only take in account rows with complete data values. 
# 
# 2. Provide an example of "the opposite use case" in which using del df['col'] might be preferred over using df.dropna()
# 
#     Using del df['col'] would be more efficient than df.dropna() when you have one or more columns that has many missing values that won't be analyzed. For example, if there is a dataset of customer transactions and there is a column called for middles names, it is likely that it isn't needed because 1) many people do not have middle names 2) it is unnecessary for financial analysis. 
#     
# 3. Discuss why applying del df['col'] before df.dropna() when both are used together could be important.
# 
#     Applying del df['col'] before df.dropna() when both are used is important due to efficiency. If you use df.dropna() before del df['col'], there is a possibility you will remove row(s) with missing values you were going to remove either way using del df['col'].
#     
#     
# 4. Remove all missing data from one of the datasets you're considering using some combination of del df['col'] and/or df.dropna() and give a justification for your approach, including a "before and after" report of the results of your approach for your dataset.
# 
#     I would remove the country column (using df['col']). This is because out of the country, state, and city columns, it is the column that is missing the most values. This is so that I can only focus on one country, such as the USA, which already has over 70,000 UFO sightings. I would then use df.dropna() to remove every state that is not in the USA to focus on areas that are only in the USA. 

# 8. 
# 
# (1) the format code df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() could be used in the UFO sightings dataset by finding the duration in seconds in each state. This would be written as "df.groupby('state')['duration (seconds)'].describe(). 
# 
# (2) df.describe() overall gives a general view of the entire dataset. on the other hand, df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() shows analaysis that is within every group col1. thus, missing values that are across all rows will be accounted for when using df.describe() while using df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() will allow a specific group to be analyzed for missing values. 
# 
# (3)
#     (A) It appears that when i forget to include "import pandas as pd", chatgpt noticed it right away. 
#     
#    "Your code looks mostly correct for loading and processing a UFO sightings dataset. However, without the actual file, I can only point out potential issues that could arise based on common problems. Here are a few things to check and correct if necessary: Importing Pandas: Make sure you have imported the Pandas library before using it. If you haven't already, add this line at the beginning of your code..."
#     
#     (B) When I put ufo_sightings_larges.csv instead of ufo_sightings_large.csv, chatgpt immediately notices this. 
#     
#    "Your code is mostly correct, but here are some common issues that could lead to errors: File Name: Check if the CSV file name is correct. You've referred to the file as ufo_sightings_larges.csv. Make sure that this is the actual name of your file. If the file is named ufo_sightings_large.csv, you should correct that."
#    
#    (C) When I used grouped_description = UFO_DATA.groupby("state")["duration(seconds)"].describe() instead of grouped_description = ufo_data.groupby("state")["duration(seconds)"].describe()
# print(grouped_description, chatgpt immediately addressed this issue and told me that "You have mistakenly referenced UFO_DATA (with uppercase letters) instead of ufo_data (with lowercase letters). Python is case-sensitive, so variable names must match exactly."
# 
#     (D) When I miss the ) in "pd.read_csv('path_to_your_file/ufo_sightings_large.csv'", chatgpt spots this and tells me that that missing ) is a syntax error. "It looks like you have a small syntax error in your code when loading the dataset. Specifically, you are missing a closing parenthesis ) for the pd.read_csv() function."
#     
#     (E) When I wrote grouped_description = ufo_data.group_by("state")["duration(seconds)"].describe() instead of grouped_description = ufo_data.groupby("state")["duration(seconds)"].describe(), chatgpt noticed this and regarded it as a minor error. "You should use groupby() instead of group_by()."
#     
#     (F) When I called the column "name" instead of "state" and duration(days) instead of duration(seconds), chatgpt mentioned that I should see again if those columns actually exist in the dataset. "Your code looks mostly correct, but there are a couple of potential issues to address: Column Names: Make sure that the column names you are using in the groupby() method (name and duration(days)) actually exist in your dataset. You may want to print the column names to verify this."
#     
#     (G) When I forget the "" (or in other words, don't write it as a string) for "state" and "duration(seconds)", chatgpt notices this immediately. "Your code has a few issues that need to be addressed for it to run correctly: Variable Names: When using groupby, you should reference the column names as strings (i.e., "state" and "duration(seconds)"). You currently have state and duration(seconds) without quotes, which will cause a NameError."
