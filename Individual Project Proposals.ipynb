    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there an association between the amount of time a person under the age of 30 spends on social media per day and their interest in  activities?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CONNECTION_social_media_time_per_day (predictor/numeric variable) \n",
    "- WELLNESS_phq_little_interest (outcome/categorical variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media can spark motivation or cause jealousy, aligning with CSCS's prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizations:\n",
    "We can group the two columns of variables based on age. \n",
    "A KDE plot will visualize the distribution of social media time and interest in activities, with the x-axis representing time spent on social media and the y-axis representing density. There'll be several curves which are categorized as levels of interest in activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can perform linear regression to examine a linear correlation between these variables assuming residuals are normally distributed,  independent, homoscedastic and reflect linearity. Using CSCS data and statsmodels.formula.api, we'll fit a linear model and obtain summary statistics including the slope. Through bootstrapping, we'll construct a 95% confidence interval for the slope estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: There is no linear association between daily social media time and level of interest in activity.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis: There is a linear association between daily social media time and level of interest in activity.\n",

    "Possible results: \n",
    "\n",
    "95% CI includes 0 &rarr; no linear association,\n",

    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Does older age affect how satisfied a person is in their life?\n",

    "## Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "DEMO_age, WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_happy (numeric)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Visualizations:\n",
    "Two histograms (one for ages below 40, another for ages 40 and above) with x-axis and y-axis representing the subjective happiness score and count, respectively, to compare the shapes and distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping can be used to compare the mean subjective happiness scores in both groups under the assumptions of an independent, representative, and large sample. A 95% confidence interval will have a range of the differences in population means. \n",

    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: Age has no effect on life satisfaction.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis: Age has an effect on life satisfaction.\n",
